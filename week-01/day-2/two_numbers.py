# Create a program that prints a few operations on two numbers: 22 and 13

# Print the result of 13 added to 22

# Print the result of 13 substracted from 22

# Print the result of 22 multiplied by 13

# Print the result of 22 divided by 13 (as a decimal fraction)

# Print the integer part of 22 divided by 13

# Print the remainder of 22 divided by 13

number_1,number_2 = 22,13
print(f'result of 13 added to 22 is {number_1 + number_2}')
print(f'result of 13 substracted from 22 is {number_1 - number_2}')
print(f'result of 13 multiplied by 13 is {number_1 * number_2}')
print(f'result of 22 divided by 13 (as a decimal fraction) is {number_1 / number_2}')
print(f'result of print the integer part of 22 divided by 13 is {number_1 // number_2}')
print(f'result of the remainder of 22 divided by 13 is {number_1 % number_2}')
